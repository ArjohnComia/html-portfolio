<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How to Train You Dragon</h3>
<p>
  This movies is my childhood. I love dragons and this movie made me want to
  have one haha. It also talks about loyalty, friendship, sacrifice, and growth.
  This made so much impact to me that changed me or shaped me into who I am
  today
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Now this movie is also peak. This sci-fi movie made me love science,
  blackholes, and space. The quote "we are the ghost of our children" really
  resonated with me and made me realize that parents do really impact a child's
  life. Amazaing movie and amazing soundtrack.
</p>
<h3>Flipped</h3>
<p>
  A cute movie. Talks about teenage or young love. Made me blush to be honest
  and cute and impactful storyline.
